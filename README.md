# Atmospheric-analysis-of-Abandoned-mines-using-rover
This project aims to design a LoRa Based Wireless Rover using Arduino Uno &amp; LoRa Module. A DHT Sensor and Gas Sensor to monitor the environment GY-68 sensor along with an Ultrasonic Sensor is used to control the rover. The rover measures the mine environment parameters like Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, Gas Levels &amp; Terrain. These parameters are critical to the design, and comprehensive analysis of these parameters ensures planning and safety of the surface and underground mining activities.

The system consists of two parts. The first part is the rover which consists of the sensors along with a LoRa module which will transmit the sensor data to the base station which is the second part of the system. Since the power distribution of arduino Uno is not enough given the number of sensors and modules, one arduino Uno was used for integrating the sensors and LoRa module and one arduino Nano was used to program the motors with motor driver. The base station consisted of LoRa receiver which receives the data from the rover. The rover operates autonomously using a simple algorithm of obstacle avoidance. Therefore, the repository consists of three arduino ino files representing each part of the system.
